Copy-pasted from the root directory, as there is not much additional information to add here.

This folder contains the dataset for our project. It contains four subfolder and 4 text files.
- The data/high-rated and data/low-rated folders contain the raw transcripts (as well as unused scripts) for the movies.
- The data/ProcessedBadScripts and data/ProcessedGoodScripts contain those same scripts, but after pre-processing was performed on them.
- data/bottom100.txt and data/top250.txt are just a list of the bottom-rated and top-rated 250 movies on IMDb (although only 100 of the latter were used).
- data/sources-high-rated.txt and data/sources-low-rated.txt contain the exact links to where the first 25 movies from each group were sourced.
